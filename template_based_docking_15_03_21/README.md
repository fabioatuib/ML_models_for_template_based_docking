# Template-based cross-docking experiment

1) All compounds optimized with HyDE
   1) optmized compounds that deviate too much from original X-tal pose
    are discarded
2) Selection of bigger receptor than default 
3) Compound-to-dock and template pairs discarded if their receptor
location doesn't match
