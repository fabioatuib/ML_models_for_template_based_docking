self template-based docking cases that results in RMSD > 3 A

1) conformer generation selected conformer with lowest Soft-MCS rmsd (unware of 0.5 A cutoff)
2) xtal poses were not HYDE optimized to filter out bad ones
3) automatic FlexX receptor definition
4) non-biologically relevant small molecule instances were not removed
